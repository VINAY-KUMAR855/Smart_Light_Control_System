# 💡 Smart Light Control System
### A system that uses your laptop camera to detect if anyone is in the room → if yes, lights ON; if no one, lights OFF. Status is displayed on screen.

## How It Works
Camera → Detect Face → Decision → Display Status on Screen
  📷         🧠           💡              🖥️
the "light ON/OFF" will be simulated on screen with text and colors

## 🖥️ Setup on Ubuntu (Do this only once)

### Step 1 — Check if Python is installed
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see something like `Python 3.10.x`. If not, install it:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

---

### Step 2 — Install OpenCV
```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
```

If you get a permission error, use:
```bash
pip3 install opencv-python --user
```

---

### Step 3 — Go to your project folder
```bash
cd smart_light_control
```

---

### Step 4 — Run the program
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## 🎮 How to Use

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Sit in front of camera | Green box appears, **LIGHT: ON** shown |
| Leave camera view | **LIGHT: OFF** shown in red |
| Press `Q` | Program exits |

---

## ❌ Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `Could not open camera` | Close browser/Zoom that might be using camera |
| `No module named cv2` | Run `pip3 install opencv-python` again |
| Camera opens but no face detected | Make sure your face is well lit, move closer |

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Connect to **Arduino** to control real lights/relays
- Add **motion sensor** as backup
- Count people and log energy saved
- Send **alert notification** if lights left ON too long
